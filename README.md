# Urban Science intensive project Estimating number of people in a given area.
## Participants: Denis Khryashchev, Eren Con, Shi Fan, Ding Ma.


###Main idea of the data side of project is to linearly regress several features (open data) against the label (number of people). The ###following open data sets were selected as predictors: turnstile, number of buses, number of tweets, number of yelp messages, Census, ###LEHD, number of parking tickets. As a predicted value we used the number of cell phones in the area. The cell phone data was collected ###in 8 locations: Museum of Natural History, Union Square, Bobst Library, Chinatown, Jay Street MetroTech, Bensonhurst, Avenue U, ###Brighton Beach. In each location the recording took place from noon to 1 p.m. on a weekday.
